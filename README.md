# RDBMS-Project
Relational Database Management System Project 
I am Amardeep Singh Bhullar. This report encapsulates all the work I during the DBMS
project assigned during the course CSCI 126. The project pushed me to think laterally and
understand the skills to create my own Relational Database. Furthermore, I learned how to create
Database(s), Schema(s), Tables, drawing data from real data sources like- www.kaggle.com. I
am extremely obliged to have taken this course, as it helped me to understand the concepts of
Database Management better. A big thank you to Dr. David Ruby for helping me every step of
the way.
